## Alternative Terms for Removal from SRAO
## ---------------------------------------
##
## Simple list of all alternative terms that are automatically
## pulled into the SRAO but then need to be removed again as
## they are unsuitable as synonyms within FAIRsharing, generally
## because those terms are already present as primary labels
## elsewhere in SRAO. 
##
## This is currently a manual process which should happen after
## each Ontofox run. However, we try to not have any values
## in this file and it is currently empty.
