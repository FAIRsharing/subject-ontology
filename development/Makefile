## Top-level targets

# By default, this Makefile will build the standalone version of the ontology.
build: build/robot.jar merge

# The build_release target should be run with a current release number specified
# with RELNUM, e.g. RELNUM=0.1.0

# The release target will create a new release directory locally with all appropriate files
# other than the refactored IRIs file, which still need to be made manually
