### Label
**Recommendation**: put your recommended class label here

**Reasoning**: Why this label is your preferred choice. Include any synonyms you think might be appropriate as well.

### IRI
**Recommendation**: The IRI you propose from a reference ontology (e.g. OBI, EFO, AgroPortal...). If you cannot find a class from a reference ontology, please state that you will require SRAO to mint an IRI.
 
**Reasoning**: Why this reference ontology / IRI is your preferred choice.

### Definition
Either state that you are happy with the definition provided by the reference ontology, or provide your own definition here, with appropriate attribution (e.g. created entirely by you, modified by you from a 3rd party such as the OED or Wikipedia).

### Hierarchy
**Recommendation**: list where in the hierarchy your term should go / which terms its parent(s) should be.

**Reasoning**: Why this hierarchy is your preferred choice.
