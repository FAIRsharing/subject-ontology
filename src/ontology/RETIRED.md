## Retiring SRAO IRIs
Sometimes, we need to retire SRAO IRIs. This only happens when a SRAO IRI (originally created because no suitable community ontology could be found) is made obsolete when we find an appropriate community ontology. In these cases, we will retire the SRAO IRI and replace it with the community IRI. This file contains a list of all such retired IRIs and their mappings.

### IRIs that have been retired with the 2025-02-23 release
