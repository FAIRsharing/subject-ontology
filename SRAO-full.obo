property_value: dcterms:description "SRAO is a hierarchy of academic disciplines that draws from the re3data subject list as well as importing terms from 7 publicly-available ontologies. This hierarchy covers all of the humanities and natural sciences and, where external vocabularies could not be found, SRAO classes were created.\n\nThe initial hierarchy and class set came from FAIRsharing user requirements. Additional classes have been drawn from the following sources:\n\n1. the re3data subject categories as listed at http://www.re3data.org/browse/by-subject/\n2. NCIT (http://dx.doi.org/10.3233/978-1-60750-949-3-33, CC BY 4.0)\n3. the EDAM Topic hierarchy as available at http://edamontology.org (http://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btt113, CC BY-SA 4.0)\n4. AgroVoc (http://agrovoc.uniroma2.it/agrovoc/agrovoc/en/, CC BY 3.0 IGO)\n5. OMIT (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0100855 and https://doi.org/10.1186/s13326-016-0064-2, CC BY 3.0)\n6.

comment: AL 14.5.2019: Refactored Immunology from the EDAM to the NCIT class due to conflation of subject areas by the EDAM class.
comment: AL: 25.9.17 [Updated AL 10.06.2019] Changed re3data label from 'Microbiology, Virology and Immunology' to 'Microbiology' as these are three distinct disciplines. All three disciplines have been removed from the Medicine hierarchy as listed by re3data. Microbiology has been asserted as a child of Biology according to NCIT and FAIRsharing curators. Virology has been asserted as a child of Microbiology to align with re3data, further refining the placement within EDAM. Immunology remains a child of Biomedical Science according to FAIRsharing curators, a modification both of the Medicine hierarchy as listed by re3data and the Biological Sciences as listed by NCIT.

comment: AL 14.5.2019: Synonym 'Morphology' was added upon the removal of the 'Systematics and Morphology' re3data class. 'Systematics and Morphology' was removed as the subject was already present via both Anatomy and Biological Systematics (via Phylogenetics).
comment: AL: 25.9.17 Anatomy is asserted as a child of Biology by re3data, and as a child of Biomedical Science by EDAM. As both are correct depending on context, both assertions have been retained.

comment: AL 18.6.2019: The NCIT class used as the source of this definition conflates 'Orthopedics' and 'Orthopedic Surgery', whereas we have two separate classes. Therefore we used the definition, but not the NCIT IRI.
comment: AL: 16.5.2019 Refactored re3data composite class 'Traumatology and Orthopaedics' into 'Traumatology' and 'Orthopaedic Surgery' according to FAIRsharing curation best practises. 'Orthopedics' itself as a medical discipline is listed as a synonym of 'Musculoskeletal Medicine'.

comment: AL 11.6.2019: The source of the definition for this class was EDAM.

comment: AL 16.5.2019: This 'composite term' (a class describing multiple concepts) is a standard conflation within this research area and is therefore retained. This is in contrast with the general rule within FAIRsharing to refactor composite terms.
