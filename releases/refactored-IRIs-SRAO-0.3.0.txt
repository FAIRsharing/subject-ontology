# List of IRIs that have moved from DRAO to SRAO in the current milestone
# There are spaces for three IRIs, but you may only need one or two of them.
# In the note, please explain what type of mapping/refactoring has been
# performed.
#
# Every time you modify this list, copy the changes to
# refactored-IRIs-current.txt within the DRAO project so that the full
# history of the changes will ultimately be present in both AO release
# directories.
#
# Examples (from release 0.2.0)
# http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OMIT_0022673|http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCIT_C18478||Note: This means that relations from DRAO first_iri are transferred to SRAO second_iri and first_iri is deprecated.
# http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OMIT_0012123|||Note: This means that first_iri is moved from DRAO->SRAO with IRI preserved.
# http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OMIT_0023533|http://edamontology.org/topic_3395|http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCIT_C93254|Note: first_iri and second_iri are deprecated and their relations transferred to third_iri.

# http://edamontology.org/topic_3077|http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ERO_0100295||Note: This means that first_iri is moved from SRAO->DRAO and takes the relations of second_iri. The second_iri is then deleted.
# http://edamontology.org/topic_0218|http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ERO_0100106||Note: This means that relations from the SRAO first_iri are transferred to the DRAO second_iri, and the first_iri is deprecated.
