more information on SRAO, and the (License)[https://github.com/FAIRsharing/subject-ontology/blob/master/LICENSE.md] file
for how you can use and re-use this ontology.

This release resolves the issues listed in the
[SRAO 0.2.0 Milestone](https://github.com/FAIRsharing/subject-ontology/milestone/2).

Note on refactoredIRIs-SRAO-RELNUM.txt: This file contains a list of IRIs that have changed since the last release. The first column contains old IRIs, and the second contains new IRIs. Their refactoring is covered in the issues listed in the milestone above.

The majority of changes in this release focussed on the reconciling of compound classes (those with more than one concept in a single class) and ensuring conformity of the naming scheme.

Please contact us at contact@fairsharing.org if you have any questions.
